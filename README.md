# Colorizer

_A tiny library for performing Sass-like manipulations to hex color codes._

## What is it?

Colorizer is a very small (3kb minified) library for handling color manipulation in much the same way as Sass. You can provide a hex code or RGB and then start multiplying, dividing, adding, or subtracting values from it (returning hex). You can also perform stepped calculations (e.g. multiply a hex code by 1.1 several times consecutively), returning an array of hex codes. Finally, you can blend two colors together, specifying a number of steps to receive between them (also returns an array of hex codes).

An actual readme is on the way.
